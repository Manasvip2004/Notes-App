The Notes App is a React Native application that allows users to create, categorize, 
search, and delete notes while supporting a dark mode feature. It integrates Firebase 
Firestore for real-time cloud storage of notes and AsyncStorage to persist theme 
preferences. The search functionality helps in quickly finding relevant notes, while the 
toggleable dark mode enhances user experience.
